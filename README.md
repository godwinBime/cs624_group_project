- SaveOne Grocery Mobile App
Introduction

In response to the increasing demand for user-friendly and cross-platform mobile applications, SaveOne Grocery App is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and React Native. This project aims to create an efficient, cost-effective, and easy-to-use grocery store mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms.
Methodology

The MERN stack is chosen for its advantages, including streamlined development processes and scalability. MongoDB provides a schemaless NoSQL database, Express JS promotes code reusability on the server side, React JS creates dynamic front-end layouts, and Node JS enables server-side JavaScript execution.
